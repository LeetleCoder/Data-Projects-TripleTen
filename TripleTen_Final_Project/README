# Zomato Sales Analysis

## Project Description

### Introduction  
This project analyzes fake company; Zomato's historical order data to evaluate sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and average order value (AOV). The objective is to uncover patterns in business performance and provide actionable insights to improve revenue and customer engagement.

### Methodology  
- Focused solely on the "Orders" dataset to maintain a clear sales-based scope.  
- Cleaned the data by filtering out refund and zero-value transactions in Tableau.  
- Tracked key metrics: Total Sales, Order Volume, AOV, and Year-over-Year (YOY) growth.  
- Created visualizations in Tableau to analyze trends over time and identify performance changes.

### Key Insights  
- Strong growth in sales and orders from late 2017 through 2018, followed by a decline post-2019, likely due to COVID-19.  
- Despite volume drops, AOV remained stable (~$463), indicating consistent customer spending behavior.  
- Most orders fell into the low to mid-value range ($100â€“$300).

### Visuals  
Visualizations include:  
- Monthly Sales Trend  
- Monthly Order Volume  
- AOV Distribution

### Conclusion  
Zomato generated ~$986.6 million in revenue from ~148,000 orders between 2017 and 2022. Performance peaked in 2018 but declined as external factors, like the pandemic, impacted order volume. AOV consistency suggests strong customer value per transaction.

### Recommendations  
- Increase AOV through bundling, upselling, and promotional campaigns.  
- Launch retention strategies such as loyalty programs.  
- Develop contingency plans to mitigate future large-scale disruptions.
