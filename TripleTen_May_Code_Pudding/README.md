# Top 50 Exercises: Calorie Burn and Movement Insights

## Project Description

### Introduction  
This was a team project completed for the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program** as part of a **Code Pudding competition**. The goal was to analyze the top 50 bodyweight and gym-based exercises to understand how exercise difficulty, muscle engagement, and equipment usage affect calories burned. The findings were used to build data-informed beginner workout plans.

## What Was Done

- Cleaned and categorized exercise data by difficulty level, targeted muscle groups, and equipment type.
- Visualized and analyzed average calorie burn per exercise using Tableau dashboards.
- Compared equipment vs. no-equipment plans for calorie efficiency.
- Developed two beginner workout templates (one with no equipment, one with basic equipment) and estimated total calories burned based on reps.

## Key Visuals

- **Calories Burned by Difficulty**:  
  - Beginner: ~189 cal / 30 min  
  - Intermediate: ~224 cal / 30 min  
  - Advanced: ~279 cal / 30 min  
- **Most Worked Muscles**: Glutes, Core, and Shoulders  
- **Total Muscle Groups vs Calories**: Exercises targeting fewer muscle groups tend to burn more calories.  
- **Top Calorie-Burning Moves**: Jumping Jacks (295 cal), Lunges (275 cal), Squats (223 cal)  

## Results

- No-equipment beginner plan:  
  - **Total Calories Burned**: 1,673  
  - **Total Reps**: 351  

- Equipment-based beginner plan:  
  - **Total Calories Burned**: 600  
  - **Total Reps**: 171  

The no-equipment routine burned significantly more calories, primarily due to higher exercise count and rep volume.

## Recommendations

- **Use no-equipment routines** for higher burn when access to gym tools is limited.  
- **Focus on exercises targeting fewer muscle groups** to maximize energy output per movement.  
- **Structure beginner plans around high-efficiency exercises** like Jumping Jacks, Lunges, and Squats for better results with limited time or tools.
