# What Is Causing Returns?

## Project Description

### Introduction  
This project was completed as part of the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program**. The goal was to investigate product return trends and identify the key factors contributing to high return rates. This analysis supports operational and policy changes by uncovering the root causes behind return behaviors using sales, logistics, customer, and geographic data.

## What Was Done

- Calculated overall return rate (25.97%) from over 12,400 orders.
- Compared both **return rate** and **total return volume** across categories, customers, and states.
- Analyzed return behavior by:
  - Product category and sub-category
  - State and region
  - Shipping mode and speed
  - Time of year (monthly trends)
  - Repeat returners and high-risk customers
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard with filters for state, customer, and shipping mode.

## Key Insights

- **Technology** had the highest average return rate, likely due to product complexity or defects.
- **Colorado and California** showed the highest state-level return rates.
- **Same Day** and **First Class shipping** had elevated return rates, suggesting impulse purchases or shipping damage.
- **Seasonal spikes** occurred in **February, August, and December**, aligning with promotions and holiday cycles.
- Some **repeat customers** consistently returned a large share of their orders.

## Results

This project provided a data-backed explanation for high product return rates and highlighted behavioral and operational red flags. The dashboard allows stakeholders to drill into high-return customers, states, and product segments interactively.

## Recommendations

- Review shipping and warehouse practices in high-return states (e.g., California, Colorado).
- Adjust shipping policies in regions where **fast shipping correlates with higher return rates**.
- Introduce safeguards or restrictions for **repeat returners**.
- Align future promotional events with **monthly return rate patterns** to reduce reverse logistics strain.
- Use the dashboard to **continuously monitor** and act on emerging return trends.
