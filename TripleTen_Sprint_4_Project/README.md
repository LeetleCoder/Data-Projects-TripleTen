# Superstore Profitability Analysis

## Project Description

### Introduction  
This project was completed as part of the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program**. The objective was to analyze sales, profit, and return patterns from a fictional superstore dataset in order to identify high- and low-performing products, subcategories, regions, and customer behavior.

## What Was Done

- Analyzed profit by subcategory and region to identify top and bottom-performing segments.
- Evaluated product-level profitability and flagged the largest loss-makers.
- Mapped average profit by state and month to guide advertising investment strategy.
- Explored product and customer return rates to recommend items for de-prioritization or further review.
- Built Tableau dashboards for dynamic filtering, trend comparison, and visual storytelling.

## Key Insights

- **Most Profitable Subcategories**: Copiers, Phones, Accessories  
- **Loss-Makers**: Tables and Bookcases consistently incurred losses across regions  
- **Top Profit States**: Indiana (October), Vermont (November), Washington (March)  
- **High Return Items**: Binders and Chalk Sticks had return rates above 25%  
- **Low Return, High Profit**: Copiers had the highest profit with the lowest return rate  
- **Recommendation**: Increase advertising spend in profitable states during peak months, and review or discontinue low-performing, high-return products

## Results

This analysis provided actionable suggestions including:
- Shifting advertising budgets toward high-margin states and time periods  
- Recommending against continued sales of products with high returns and poor profit performance  
- Prioritizing promotion of consistently high-performing categories such as Copiers and Phones

## Recommendations

- Allocate advertising budget to top-performing state/month pairs  
- Halt or reassess the sale of poor performers like Tables, Bookcases, and high-return items like certain Binders  
- Invest in subcategories with strong profit and retention indicators (e.g., Copiers, Accessories)  
- Further investigate customer behavior for high-return individuals for potential retention issues
